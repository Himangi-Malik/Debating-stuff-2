Good evening to the panelists , the jury , I stand here before you as the prime minister to stand for the motion that the house believes that “In industrializing economies, THW heavily prioritise providing excellent education to students who have a greater potential to succeed as opposed to equalizing educational access to all students.” 

Industrializing economies:- industrializing economies refers to economies of developing nations, economies which are still growing and 
Prioritize:- determine the order for dealing with (a series of items or tasks) according to their relative importance



Points:
Prioritize: “excellent “ edu to better potential, as opposed to equalizing edu access to all students we do not mean striking off basic right to edu till a certain age, 6-14 age , we just mean to give greater attention and resources to the students who have more compelling chance 
The statement reflects a choice that policymakers in industrializing economies may face when deciding how to allocate limited educational resources. On one hand, prioritizing excellent education for students with a higher potential to succeed could be seen as a strategy to produce a more skilled and competitive workforce. By focusing resources on high-potential students, the hope is that they will receive a more enriched educational experience, enabling them to excel and contribute significantly to the country's economic and technological development.
This approach may also align with the idea that investing in the most promising students can yield a higher return on investment in terms of their future contributions to society. Supporters of this view argue that by nurturing and developing the most talented individuals, the country can become more competitive in the global economy, leading to overall prosperity.
